This library is almost identical to the SoftwareSerial library included with Arduino 1.0.5.
I've  modified the size of the buffer to 128 bytes (from 64) to suit this project.
So far, this seems to be fine.

Unfortunately, overriding the buffer size constant from the project itself doesn't work.
(Presumably because ino & avr-gcc don't do multiple pre-processor scans, or something)

#define _SS_MAX_RX_BUFF 128
